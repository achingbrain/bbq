## Language Compiler

Language files are stored next to the JavaScript class files in the following directory structure:

	+- src/
	   +- main/
	      +- javascript/
	         +- com/
	            +- myapp/
	               |
	               +- MyClass.js
	               +- MyClass.lang.en_GB.xml
	               +- AnotherClass.js
	               +- AnotherClass.lang.en_GB.xml

The locale the file corresponds to is specified as part of the file name - in the above example there are translations for the en_GB locale.

Similar to the CSS compiler, the [language compiler](bbq-compiler/apidocs/org/bbqjs/compiler/language/LanguageCompiler.html) looks for language translation files to turn into an [XML Java Properties file](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-tiger02254/index.html).  The XML version of the properties format is used to ensure UTF encoding is used so non-ASCII characters are not corrupted.

<pre><code class="language-java">
// This is the compile target locale
Locale locale = Locale.UK;

// If any translations files are not available for the target locale, this is the fallback locale
Locale defaultLocale = Locale.US;

// These are any properties files that should be included in the output file
String[] includes = new String[] {
	"src/main/resources/constants.properties"
};

// The input file is the page file.
URL inputFile = new URL("file:///path/to/file.js");

// This is the package that holds the page files for my application
String pagePackage = "myapp.page";

// This is where the compiled JavaScript will get written to
OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(File.createTempFile("foo", "properties"));

// This is where the compiler should search for source files in addition to the classpath
String[] sourceRoots = new String[] {
	"src/main/javascript"
};

Compiler compiler = new LanguageCompiler(locale, defaultLocale, includes);
compiler.compile(inputFile, pagePackage, outputStream, sourceRoots);
